Bootcamp pandas challenge week 4

As a comment I did notice that in this challenge we were asked to take averages of averages which statistcally is not correct in my view. See the last summary by type. 

The analysis of schools as per the attached script brought a number of interesting conclusions:

I'll start with the "unexpected" and that is that the lower spending schools (budget per student)have a better pass % than the higher spending schools. Further data will need to be gathered to determine where the differences in spending are and if there are any trends.

As may be expected the larger schools have worse pass rates than the smaller ones though there is no data as to why this is the case. 
An interesting observation is that gaps in average scores are relatively small, about a 3% difference in favour of the smaller schools, however the gap in pass % is much higher, especially the gap in overall pass % where the smaller schools are around 12% better (79.1% versus 70.3%)

A similar observation can be made when looking at the difference between Government and Independent schools where the overall pass % of Independent schhols is 9% better than that of the Government schools whilst the average scores show a much lesser variance between the 2 types.

I would like to do a further analasys of the spending differences between Government and Independenty schools as it appears that Government schools have a higher per student budget. There could possibly be best practices that could be transferred, especially in light of the variance in overall pass% of both school types.
